/*
 * The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it
 * may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
 *
 * We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
 * There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two
 * digits in the numerator and denominator.
 *
 * If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.
