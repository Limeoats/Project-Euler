/*
 * The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits
 * 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.
 *
 * Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:
 *
 * d2d3d4=406 is divisible by 2
 * d3d4d5=063 is divisible by 3
 * d4d5d6=635 is divisible by 5
 * d5d6d7=357 is divisible by 7
 * d6d7d8=572 is divisible by 11
 * d7d8d9=728 is divisible by 13
 * d8d9d10=289 is divisible by 17
 *
 * Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.
