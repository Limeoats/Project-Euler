//The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
//1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
//The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
//(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
//Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
// numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 ? 385 = 2640.
//Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
// numbers and the square of the sum.
